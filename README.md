# Kioptrix Level 1 - Enumeration and Exploitation

## Overview
This repository contains detailed instructions and commands for enumerating and exploiting the Kioptrix Level 1 machine in a penetration testing environment. The provided instructions aim to help ethical hackers and cybersecurity enthusiasts learn and practice their skills in a controlled environment.

## Contents
1. `kioptrix_enum.md`: Detailed explanation of the enumeration process, including commands for finding the IP address of the Kioptrix machine.
2. `kioptrix_port_scan.md`: Detailed explanation of port scanning using `nmap`, including commands for scanning for open ports and service enumeration.
3. `kioptrix_vulnerability_scan.md`: Detailed explanation of vulnerability scanning using `nikto`, including commands for finding vulnerabilities in the target machine.
4. `kioptrix_directory_brute_forcing.md`: Detailed explanation of directory brute-forcing using `dirbuster`, including commands for finding all possible files and directories on the target machine.
5. `kioptrix_smb_enum.md`: Detailed explanation of SMB enumeration, including commands for identifying the SMB version and connecting to SMB shares.
6. `kioptrix_ssh_connection.md`: Detailed explanation of SSH connection attempts, including methods to connect and potential issues encountered.

## Why it's used
- `arp-scan` and `netdiscover` are used to discover the IP address of the Kioptrix machine within the network.
- `nmap` is used for detailed port scanning and service enumeration, providing valuable information about the target machine's vulnerabilities.
- `nikto` is used to perform a vulnerability scan and find different types of vulnerabilities in the target machine.
- `dirbuster` is used for directory brute-forcing to find all possible files and directories on the target machine.
- SMB enumeration is used to identify the SMB version and connect to SMB shares.
- SSH connection attempts are used to establish an SSH connection to the target machine.

## Additional Information
- **Purpose**: The purpose of this guide is to educate and enable users to conduct ethical penetration testing practices.
- **Caution**: Use these techniques responsibly and with proper authorization.
